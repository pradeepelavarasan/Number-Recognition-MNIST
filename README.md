# Number-Recognition-MNIST
This project explains a basic way of creating a Number Recognition application on MNIST data set using custom CNN model and achieving 99.2% validation accuracy. It also includes basic definitions of CNN (Convolution Neural Networks) Concepts.

# Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) Concepts

## 1.Convolution
The process of convolving on the input image to get a output image

## 2.Filters/Kernels


## 3.Epochs
## 4.1x1 Convolution
## 5.3x3 Convolution
## 6.Feature Maps
## 7.Activation Function
## 8.Receptive Field
